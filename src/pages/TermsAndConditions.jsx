        <h1>Terms & Conditions — ReadTech</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 21 September 2025</p>
  
        <p>
          By placing a sell order with Go Green Gadgets (“we”, “us”, “our”), you agree to these Terms and Conditions.
          They are designed to ensure a clear, fair, and legally binding process and to protect our business from loss
          caused by inaccurate information, misuse, or fraud.
        </p>
  
        <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not submit a sell order.</p>
        <p>We recommend you print or save a copy for your records.</p>
  
        <h2>1. Eligibility & Contract Formation</h2>
        <p>Our services are intended for residents and businesses in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Orders from other regions may be declined at our discretion.</p>
  
        <p>To place an order, you must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be at least 18 years old, or have the consent of a parent/guardian.</li>
          <li>Be legally capable of entering into a binding contract.</li>
          <li>Be the legal owner of the device(s) being sold, with full rights to transfer ownership.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>When you submit an order through our website, you create a binding contract with us.</p>
  
        <p>Ownership of devices passes to us once:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We receive the device(s), and</li>
          <li>Payment is issued.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>We may request proof of purchase or ID. If you cannot provide this, payment may be withheld or the device(s) recycled.</p>
  
        <h2>2. Cancellations</h2>
        <p>You may cancel your order at any point before the device(s) are shipped.</p>
        <p>Once devices are shipped, cancellation is no longer possible.</p>
        <p>If you want devices returned after shipping, a £15 handling and postage fee per parcel applies.</p>
        <p>Devices that cannot be returned (e.g., unsafe batteries, blacklisted IMEIs) may be recycled without payment.</p>
  
        <h2>3. Quotes & Valuations</h2>
        <p>Online quotes are estimates only and are not guaranteed.</p>
        <p>Final values are determined solely by our inspection team after testing and verification.</p>
        <p>If a device’s condition differs from what you declared, we will provide a revised quote.</p>
  
        <p>Revised quotes are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sent by email.</li>
          <li>Valid for 7 calendar days.</li>
          <li>Automatically accepted and paid if you do not respond within 7 days.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>If you request the device to be returned after rejecting a revised quote, the £15 return fee must be paid first.</p>
        <p>Accessories (chargers, cases, boxes, SIMs, etc.) do not affect valuations and will not be returned.</p>
  
        <h2>4. Device Inspection Process</h2>
        <p>Every device is tested on arrival. Tests may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Power on/off functionality.</li>
          <li>Screen, touch, LCD, and pixel checks.</li>
          <li>Battery diagnostics (capacity, charge cycles, maximum capacity %).</li>
          <li>Button, port, speaker, microphone, and vibration functionality.</li>
          <li>Camera and flash tests.</li>
          <li>Network connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mobile signal).</li>
          <li>Sensor checks (proximity, accelerometer, Face ID/Touch ID, NFC).</li>
          <li>IMEI/ESN blacklist and finance checks.</li>
          <li>Software checks to confirm the device has not been rooted/jailbroken.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>Our classification of condition (Great, Good, Poor, Faulty) is final.</p>
